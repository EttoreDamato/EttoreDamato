Hi, i'm Ettore D'Amato and i am on my way to master data analysis.
Currently i only know a few tools such as python and SQL, but i consider myself a fast learner and plan to master every tool that can make me a great data scientist until 2024.
If you can help me with whatever, i'll be glad to meet you.
